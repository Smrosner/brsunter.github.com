	<h2 class="title">Forty Hours of Travel, First Impressions, and Frogger in Real Life.</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>This is a bit of a long entry, but I haven’t had internet for about 5
days. My last couple days in town were exactly what I wanted. I got to
relax after a tough finals week, see everyone at my brother’s graduation
party, and spend a long day chilling at the beach. Packing everything I
need for the next 3 months turned out to be surprisingly easy and in a
way I’m looking forward to living in a more minimalist way.</p>

<p>This trip is the longest I’ve ever travelled in one stretch. Including
layovers, it took me about forty hours for me to get from Melbourne to
Chengdu. Thankfully, if college has taught me one thing, it’s how to
function without sleep. Despite the long travel time, it went just about
as well as a forty-hour trek could go. There were no delays and many
people in my group had the same flight itinerary so we all quickly
became friends. The route we took was from Tampa to Houston to Los
Angeles to Guanzhong to Chengdu. On the flight from Guanzhong I made my
first attempt at communicating in Chinese: I asked the Stewardess for a
beer. She hands me a can of Tsing Tao with a huge smile on her face. I
couldn’t decide if she was surprised to see such a white guy speaking
Mandarin or if she thought it was funny to serve alcohol to someone with
the grammar of a preschooler.</p>

<p>Before I know it, I’m stepping off the plane into the hot humid Chengdu
International Airport. We are the only white people in sight. I am
officially a minority. We pick up our bags and search for our driver
who’s a UF in Chengdu sign. To my surprise, a group of Chinese students
from our university are there to welcome us. Their English is very good
and they talked with us about Chengdu. These students were so nice and
despite going to college on the other side of the world, they didn’t
seem all that different from UF students. I thought talking with these
normal university students was the most interesting part of the day. It
definitely gave me a little perspective on what life is like for the
average person here. They ask me almost as many questions about America
as I asked about China. They tell us that they’re freshman, however they
look so much younger than the freshman in the United States. They look
only 15 years old at the latest. We pack our bags into the tiny cab and
hit the road.</p>

<p>From the beginning, I knew this was going to be no normal cab ride. Our
driver practically floors it out of the airport parking lot. I have
never seen driving like I’ve seen today in my whole life. There were
cars in between lanes, there were cars on the sidewalk, there were cars
speeding into oncoming traffic, in fact just about any area that could
fit a car had someone trying to drive their car through it. We encounter
a traffic jam, so our driver barrels straight into oncoming traffic,
with cars ahead, and does a quick U-turn into the oncoming lanes exit.
The whole ride over we missed colliding into other vehicles by mere
inches. The whole 20-minute ride was accompanied by a cacophony of
honking, shouting, and sirens. We soon arrive at the university and
we’re all happy that we survived the ride.</p>

<p>The first thing we notice is that the dorm and campus look a little
older and less maintained than they did in the pictures. In fact, this
place doesn’t look like the pictures at all. It seems that many
buildings that could have looked really good at one point, have been
totally unmaintained. This seems to be a common thing in Chengdu. Also,
our dorm definitely appears to be located in one of the less affluent
parts of the city. However, the rooms here are decent and most
importantly they’re well air-conditioned. After sitting in a cramped
airplane for most the previous two days, we were all eager to explore
the city. I dropped off my luggage, changed, and immediately headed
outside to meet the others from the group. We, along with our student
guides, decide that we’re going to explore the city. The first thing I
notice while walking around was how much the locals stared us at. I felt
like I was in Inception and the projections just realized I wasn’t
supposed to be there. Even in such a big city, there were almost no
white people in sight. It seems the people who got the most attention
were people with blonde hair and tall people.</p>

<p>In Chengdu, people are everywhere and you’re constantly surrounded by a
flurry of activity. We had many near misses of scooters and motorcycles
speeding down the sidewalk. Crossing the street literally requires you
to risk your life. We had a couple people from our group get stuck in
the middle of a huge intersection with busses and cars speeding by just
a couple feet away. Unlike in America, cars here DO NOT stop for
pedestrians, even if they’re only going like 5 mph. Navigating the city
is a perpetual game of high stakes Frogger.</p>

<p>Soon we all started to get hungry and all yearned for our first taste of
real Chinese food. We enter a noodle bar in the basement of a shopping
center. It was here where I first realized how completely helpless I was
without speaking the language. Almost nobody here speaks English. I’m
sure relying on speaking for my survival will speed up my learning. I
see a picture of an appetizing plate on the menu and ask our student
guide what it is. He tells me its chicken liver mixed with chopped
habanero peppers. I decide that nuking my stomach with organ meats and
insanely spicy peppers on the very first day is not a wise idea. I wind
up just getting some noodles with beef. By default, most of the food
I’ve had here has been pretty spicy. I love spicy food, so this works
out for me, however a lot of the people in my group are uncomfortable
with even the normal amount of spiciness. This was the first dish I’ve
had with the Sichuan peppercorn, which is an extremely tasty an
interesting flavor. Its completely indescribable and has a strange
numbing effect on the mouth.</p>

<p>Next we head to the historic part of Chengdu. The architecture is
completely amazing and our student guide, Vivian, tells us that it’s
over 1000 years old. She laughs when I tell her we have nothing in the
United States even 300 years old. The district is full of tiny shops
selling interesting candy and other traditional Chinese things. This
area is beautiful, but unfortunately it’s stuffed to the brim with
Chinese tourists. After a while, I take another death defying taxi ride
back to campus and have one of the most needed showers of my life. Still
itching for adventure, a group of us decide to go explore the city at
night and try and find an internet café, since none of us could log on
in our dorms. We go to another noodle bar and get seriously heckled by
the owner for our horrible Mandarin pronunciation. One popular type of
street vendor here that usually comes out during the night are kebab
stands. They have every type of meat you can imagine, including squid on
a stick and various types of intestines, laid out on the cart. You pick
which one you want and they fry it in oil on the spot. Unfortunately at
this point I was so stuffed from the noodle bar that I couldn’t possibly
eat any more. The food is so incredibly cheap here that for under one
usd I got more beef noodles that I could possibly finish. Those of you
who have seen how much I eat will realize how much food this is. In
addition to the noodles, I got a half-liter of beer for about 30 cents.</p>

<p>We get back to the dorms and to my dismay, my key wont open my door.
Somehow, the key managed to lock the door from the outside, but couldn’t
unlock it. I freaked out a little bit because the front desk man spoke
no English whatsoever, and I wasn’t sure how well I could communicate a
broken key using just hand gestures. However, by some miracle, it just
so happens that a girl from UF who had been here for a year was in the
lobby in the middle of the night and could speak perfect Chinese. Soon
the front deskman, my new friend Courtney, and I head upstairs to fix
the lock. The front desk guy, nicknamed “older brother”, is the most
stereotypical Chinese person I have seen so far and is a huge goofball.
He’s trying to talk to me in Mandarin the whole time and Courtney is
laughing the whole way up. Apparently he thinks, “I’m a very tall and
handsome man”. Thankfully we get the door open without any trouble. By
this point there was a group of UF students along with Courtney and her
Chinese friends in the hallway. We all talk and joke around for a long
time. Courtney gives us some great advice and offers to take us shopping
the next day. We gladly accept her invitation, as having someone who
speaks the language is invaluable.</p>

<p>Forgive me if some of this post is a little unclear; its been over two
days since I’ve slept. Without a doubt, China is the craziest and most
interesting place I’ve ever been. Nobody here speaks English, so to
survive I need to pick up Mandarin fast. The first day has been so much
fun and I’ve met so many great people. I was hoping for a crazy
adventure this summer and I definitely got one.</p>
